List the changes that are applied to the repository in the `$GOPATH/src` directory.

## Description

`ghq` provides a way to organize remote repository clones, like `go get` does. However, when we are operating multiple projects, there is a disadvantage that the progress of the project in `$GOPATH` is hard to watch or check.

`gch` recursively list up a project directory in the `$GOPATH`, and get that `git status`.

*==> [`ghq`](https://github.com/motemen/ghq) + [`peco`](https://github.com/peco/peco) + [`gch`](https://github.com/b4b4r07/gch) = BEST Development Environment !*

***DEMO:***
